            THE ALARM rings. Kristelle Ventura (3 BS LM) stirs awake, her hand instinctively reaching past the buzzing phone and toward the laptop. Unfinished paragraphs and unread emails await her. While the computer boots up, she does something else—anything else, really—from brushing her teeth to making her bed. "A minute wasted is a minute I could’ve slept," she says.
Ventura is one of many financial aid scholars in the Loyola Schools (LS) who continues to grapple with the effects of the nationwide <a href="https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/01/29/21/metro-manila-13-areas-stay-under-gcq-general-community-quarantine-lockdown-in-february-covid-19-update">quarantine</a>. She faces difficulties related to sustaining a conducive online learning setup while helping out with her family’s finances. Despite these personal battles, Ventura powers through hurdle after hurdle.

            "Para na daw akong machine kasi tuloy-tuloy lang ako (I’m called a machine since I work continuously)," Ventura recalls, referring to her boyfriend. At the pace she is working, her sleep averages three to four hours. Every hour of the day must be allotted for a task, from household chores to academic work. Eating lunch has a time limit, and the same goes for taking a break.

            This is how Ventura manages her time between school work and an online freelance job, the latter being born out of present circumstances. Like many other Filipinos, her mother and her cousin lost their jobs earlier in the lockdown. Due to health concerns, her mom cannot afford to leave their home and find another job. This prompted Ventura to help in paying for utility bills, rental fees, and groceries.

            "I’m proud of [earning]. It’s a different feeling when you can contribute to help your family," Ventura adds. She recently managed to buy a kitchen set—complete with pots, pans, and knives for her mom.

            However, her headstrong attitude is put to the test when confronting other challenges directly related to the pandemic. At one point during the quarantine, her cousin tested positive for COVID-19. Ventura herself started experiencing fatigue around the same time, leading to further emotional distress given that they live under the same roof.<br><br>
"Ang hirap mag aral kapag alam mong there’s a risk [of getting infected] already that’s present (It’s difficult to study if you know there’s a risk [of getting infected] already that’s present)," Ventura recalls.<br><br>
During such times of heightened anxiety, Ventura turns to a few close friends for emotional support, as they provide her with a safe space to confide in without the pressure of having to update them regularly. She is also grateful to the Office of Admission and Aid (OAA) for its efforts in mitigating scholars’ issues, such as unstable internet connection. Ventura herself received a WiFi <a href="https://www.uswitch.com/broadband/guides/what-is-a-mobile-dongle/#:~:text=A%20dongle%20is%20a%20small,be%20used%20on%20the%20go">dongle</a>—a USB device that allows internet access—from the OAA upon reaching out to the office. "OAA has been helping out a lot, like proactively helping out," Ventura says, "They’re very personal in their approach."

        <p class="article-text">
            Online learning issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the onset of natural disasters like typhoons continue to challenge the LS scholar population. With problems ranging from <a href="https://theguidon.com/1112/main/2020/10/signal-lost/">internet accessibility</a> to <a href="https://theguidon.com/1112/main/2020/12/braving-deeper-waters/">financial burden</a>, some scholars still face inescapable obstacles.<br><br>
Despite this year’s scholar <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheGUIDON/posts/3632158500156609">population</a> reaching record heights amid mounting online learning concerns, Christine Escalona-Magboo remains steadfast in her duties as an OAA Scholarship Officer. She attends to scholars’ every problem: Academics, mental health issues, and even unsympathetic teachers.<br><br>
As a scholarship officer, Magboo knows the likes of Ventura’s dilemmas. "Financial problems are still the most pressing [concerns] of scholars, with many breadwinners losing their jobs," she states.<br><br>
In the midst of hardships, she advises scholars to communicate with their designated program department chairs, secretary, and staff for their concerns. Due to the increase in scholars, Magboo points out that the OAA remains busy. Nevertheless, Magboo is determined to help students. "If we don’t respond to you immediately, please don’t be shy to send a message again to follow up," she explains.<br><br>
Magboo also encourages the need to establish personal limits: "The blurred lines between studies and personal life can be overwhelming, so setting up a boundary can help keep you sane," she notes.

        <p class="article-text">
            Despite the varying circumstances faced by scholars, Magboo maintains an optimistic view toward the scholar sector having witnessed higher grades in the last semester. "The number of scholars who got a 4.0 [Quality Point Index] [...] has tripled. Whereas in a regular sem, around 20 to 30 students get a 4.0 QPI, for last semester, the number has reached 90!" she says.

            With a new semester dawning, scholars continue to keep their heads high. In the face of many difficult circumstances, perseverance remains at the heart of their studies. "For me, the ones with the most obligation to give back are the ones that have been recipients of generosity," says Ventura.
