            IN A virtual world where communication is stripped down to emails and pixelated faces, connecting with people has become challenging. In the absence of facial cues that one may easily find in an on-site setting, Ateneo’s neurodivergent students face unique learning difficulties amid the shift to online learning.<br><br>
With everyone hunkered down in their own homes, it is difficult to identify intangible problems like online learning adjustments. Pia Cabañero (2 AB IS), a neurodivergent Atenean, had just settled down with the nuances of college life when online classes brought another wave of adjustments last year. With varying difficulties, she tackles the unfamiliar realm of online learning to create fulfilling experiences.

            A <a href="https://neurocosmopolitanism.com/neurodiversity-some-basic-terms-definitions/">neurodivergent</a> person has cognitive abilities that differ from the way most people think or behave.

            Cabañero is diagnosed with ASD, a condition exhibited through difficulties in socializing or learning through traditional methods. Because of this, she finds the adjustment process for online learning a long and taxing journey. “I just really miss the presence of a teacher, [teaching] us the lectures, giving us their insights,” Cabañero laments. She also fears that distance learning would make it harder for her to understand the lessons in the long run.

            To keep up with the limited conversational aid, she hopes for modules in Canvas to be completely accessible throughout the semester. This sentiment responds to the University’s most widely-used <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16vQqqXacTYl9kE-roxVPTuotbZhl7VpkRQsO-DzhI2M/edit#heading=h.8039gjd4k0gz">Learning Management System’s</a> feature that allows the “locking” of learning modules, such that students can only access these after a set date or after completing a prior module.<br><br>
“I also wish we could have more [...] supplementary material that isn’t too long,” Cabañero says. “It can be videos [or] short articles that could really help.”<br><br>
Besides learning difficulties, neurodivergent people also struggle with soft skills—such as reading social cues and coping with anxiety—that are useful in communicating with others and in managing work. However, this notion does not apply to all according to Loyola Schools Office of Guidance and Counseling (LSOGC) Guidance Counselor Analyn Roquita Ripotola. “Spectrum talaga sila, na kailangan every student with ASD or every student na considered neurodivergent has to be [considered] a special case,” she says.<br><br>
(They’re really a spectrum, where every student with ASD or every student that’s considered neurodivergent has to be [considered] a special case.)

            Although socializing remains an important aspect of Cabañero’s college experience, she finds difficulty in bonding with others as online interactions easily become transactional. Despite these setbacks, Cabañero continues to count her blessings. “I really appreciate the accessible features of the Canvas,” she says. The Inbox feature, in particular, delights her. “If you wanna talk to your profs, it’s so easy!” she adds. <br><br>
Cabañero is also thankful for having found a support system in the <a href="https://www.ateneospeed.org/">Ateneo Special Education Society (SPEED)</a>, a support group that aims to create inclusive spaces for persons with special needs (PWSNs) within and outside the Ateneo. Cabañero, who is also the Ateneo SPEED’s Creative Director, shares that the organization’s mental health check-ins provide a sense of accommodation and acceptance for its members during the pandemic.

            Aside from receiving support from focus groups, neurodivergent Ateneans can also enjoy more visibility in the Sanggunian through the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ADMUSanggu/posts/10156787678638075">Commission on Persons with Special Needs Inclusion (CSPI)</a> nested under the Sanggunian Office of the President’s Department of Student Rights. Since its establishment on August 4, 2019, the commission has aimed to provide sectoral representation to PWSNs in the Central Assembly. The CSPI hopes to achieve this by lobbying for the necessary policies and facilities that will ultimately promote an inclusion mindset in Ateneans and develop an accessible environment for PWSNs.

            Ripotola adds that the LSOGC is another support system for neurodivergent students on campus. When neurodivergent Ateneans declare their conditions upon admission to the Ateneo, she explains that the LSOGC closely collaborates with both the home and classroom to understand the multiplicity of each neurodivergent Atenean’s experiences.<br><br>
Ripotola elaborates that collaboration with the home includes conducting check-ins through online video calls or texts with the student and their parents. She adds that communicating with professors, on the other hand, involves formal e-mail exchanges where students express their concerns to the LSOGC, who then coordinates with the professors.<br><br>
In view of online learning, especially, Ripotola says that the virtual classroom is one of the most important support systems for neurodivergent students. She dubs the teaching faculty as “frontliners” for neurodivergent Ateneans because of their close interactions with each other. In order to respond to academic concerns that arise from either the students or the professors, the LSOGC requests the faculty to make necessary adjustments such as finding alternative requirements or discussion methods.<br><br>
The acceptance of a sector is inseparable from accommodating its needs; close collaboration and research is still needed in order to achieve inclusivity and accessibility for neurodivergent Ateneans.  In recognizing and responding to neurodivergent Ateneans’ needs, the University’s stakeholders can level the playing field of online learning.
