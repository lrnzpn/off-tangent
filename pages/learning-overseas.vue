                STRIKING THE balance between home and school is a challenge shared by every student during the COVID-19 pandemic. In Ateneo, no student was fully prepared to leave the Red Brick Road quiet and empty as classes went fully online.<br><br>
                The shift to distance learning entails constant adjustments in one’s daily lifestyle as students fulfill their academic requirements while doing their household duties. However, for some Ateneans, the suspension of on-site classes meant traveling thousands of miles away from campus.

"My parents did not feel comfortable leaving [me and my sisters] behind with the uncertainty of what else could hit the Philippines while they were gone," Gamboa says.

            On the other hand, Peralta’s move to San Francisco, California was unexpected. She initially went to the city to visit her mom and sister who have lived there permanently since 2019. However, the family decided that it would be best for her to stay in the US following strict travel restrictions.<br><br>
            Upon their arrival in their overseas homes, Gamboa and Perlata had to juggle the demands of their lives in the US with their classes in the Ateneo. Regardless of the state they moved to, one common reality dawned for both of them as they adjusted to studying abroad: Timezone difficulty.<br><br>
            Peralta feels like she is living "separate lives," balancing her full-time job at a retail chain with her academic commitments and duties as co-captain of the Women’s Taekwondo team. "By the time finals came around, I often was awake for at least 30-hours straight. Most of my subjects required group outputs so I had to adjust to the working times of my peers," she adds.<br><br>
            Aside from this, Peralta shares that being miles away from the Philippines made her feel powerless in pushing for change in her community, having once been an active volunteer for sociopolitical mobilizations. "I hated being so far away when so much was happening back home. I’m used to always being the first to volunteer and participate in funding drives, soup kitchens, protests, and relief operations," she explains.<br><br>
            Similarly, Gamboa shares that she surmounted a semester filled with meetings held at 3:00 AM to fulfill her commitments as a student and the Health Sciences Society President. However, surviving the hectic adjustments that come with studying abroad does not equate to evading inescapable drawbacks.

            As students relocate to different parts of the world, the online learning set-up bears unique benefits and challenges. Ateneo Institute for the Science and Art of Learning and Teaching Assistant Director Galvin Ngo says that distance learning has made courses more accessible for students abroad.<br><br>
            "While face to face classes are still prohibited, the experience should be more or less the same as those who reside in the Philippines, since everyone gets access to the same set of resources and activities," Ngo explains.<br><br>
            However, Ngo admits that students abroad may miss out on possible learning opportunities that would usually be present in face to face teaching.<br><br>
            In contrast to their peers in the Philippines, Ateneans abroad may experience feelings of isolation as they adjust to their current environment while juggling online classes and meetings. Furthermore, academic and social isolation has been <a href="https://www.shs-conferences.org/articles/shsconf/pdf/2018/14/shsconf_ichss2018_05005.pdf">associated</a> with the quality of learning experience in the University setting as students abroad tend to have trouble communicating with their peers and instructors.

            "The conflicting time zones either means staying up really late to see my friends or waking up really early... to talk to them or to study with them [online]," Gamboa shares.<br><br>
With students overseas struggling to keep up with their peers in the Philippines due to time zone differences, they are now forced to pull all-nighters to attend synchronous classes and fulfill academic requirements.<br><br>
Studies have shown that this can have adverse effects on students’ physical and mental health. Psychologists who have studied sleep deprivation observed that inadequate sleep would <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326300672_Effect_of_Sleep_Deprivation_on_the_Academic_Performance_and_Cognitive_Functions_among_the_College_Students_A_Cross_Sectional_Study">lead</a> to negative effects on one’s academic performance and cognitive abilities such as decreased attention span. Additionally, sleep-deprived individuals <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258292438_Sleep_Deprivation_and_Cognitive_Performance">tend to be easily irritable </a> and <a href="https://vantage.theguidon.com/papers-eyebags-dangers-sleep-deprivation/">prone to memory loss</a>.<br><br>
Peralta experienced these biophysical drawbacks as she shared that she had an "out-of-body experience" when she was called for recitation during her synchronous sessions for her Philosophy class. "I was easily able to answer my professor but then [my] classmate had a clarification. The professor then asked me to repeat what I had said, but I was entirely unable to because I was just too out of it," she explains.
As students are robbed of opportunities to interact and learn with their classmates on campus, Ateneans abroad now need to exert a deliberate yet tiring effort to be able to grasp their modules and balance work with personal life.

            After surviving the rollercoaster of adjustments in the first semester, Gamboa and Peralta believe that the difficulties of studying in another country can be overcome through open communication with their professors early on.<br><br>
"I think it would be beneficial for profs to always keep themselves aware of whether or not they have students who are studying abroad. It… will hopefully allow the professor to be understanding and conscious of ensuring asynchronous recordings of lectures are posted on Canvas," Gamboa explains.

            She also shares that despite surpassing the obstacles of studying abroad, the woes of being unable to spend her last year on the Loyola Schools campus are overbearing. "I know I can’t get back everything I once hoped to relive, but I know life doesn’t end because my journey in the Ateneo is over," Gamboa says.

            Similarly missing the hustle and bustle of the life she once lived in Katipunan, Peralta hopes for the return of onsite classes by the next academic year as she feels that she cannot take another year of online classes.<br><br>
            With the <a href="https://www.rappler.com/nation/philippines-receives-first-delivery-covid-19-vaccine-sinovac-february-28-2021">arrival</a> of COVID-19 vaccines in the country, both Gamboa and Peralta hope for Ateneans to be swiftly vaccinated so students can finally return to the University they once knew. "I hope it will allow for onsite classes to resume, and for the first year students to finally experience the beauty of learning on our campus," Gamboa adds.<br><br>
            Despite their distance from the Philippines, Ateneans abroad note how studying online has helped them realize the importance of their commitment in pursuing their education as part of forming a better society.<br><br>
            "I hope that this whole pandemic taught each of us the importance of a strong public health infrastructure, good governance, and the need for society to work together towards creating a collective action for change," Gamboa says.
